This repository contains short tutorials to learn R and then apply this
learning to different problems in genomics data science. The entire
course is pretty much a work in progress and more tutorials will be
added to this repo in the near future.

As of now, the tutorials should be studied in the following sequence:  
1\. R\_basics  
2\. vectors  
3\. matrices  
4\. dataframes\_1  
5\. dataframes\_2  
6\. dataframes\_3  
7\. lists  
8\. dplyr  
9\. pipe\_operator
